# Application Logger

This logger package was made to serve as a simple replacement 
to a logger being used by Zend.

When your log files should have each log-line in a JSON
format for other services such as DataDog to interact with,
this serves as a suitable replacement logger service.

This was only produced as a proof of concept.
